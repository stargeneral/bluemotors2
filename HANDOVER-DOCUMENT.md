## CRITICAL: Security Actions Required

### 🚨 URGENT - Regenerate Exposed API Keys

During deployment, the following keys were briefly exposed in git history before being removed:

**1. Stripe Test Keys (REGENERATE IMMEDIATELY)**
- **Previous Publishable Key:** `pk_test_51RMp23BT9BKRDkKSnm...` (EXPOSED - DEACTIVATE)
- **Previous Secret Key:** `sk_test_51RMp23BT9BKRDkKSjd...` (EXPOSED - DEACTIVATE)
- **Action:** Log into https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys and generate NEW test keys

**2. DVLA API Key (REGENERATE IMMEDIATELY)**
- **Previous Key:** `w2unkuUU9hapP9C8P7x2R62kZ5GNTtYu4MGfLpQj` (EXPOSED - DEACTIVATE)
- **Action:** Log into https://developer-portal.driver-vehicle-licensing.api.gov.uk/ and generate a NEW key

### Why This Happened
GitHub's push protection detected the keys in the initial commit history. We removed them and started fresh, but best practice is to rotate any exposed credentials.

---

## Configuration Setup Required

### Step 1: Configure wp-config.php

Add the following to your WordPress `wp-config.php` file (above the "That's all" comment):

```php
/* Blue Motors Southampton Configuration */
// Stripe Keys (GET NEW KEYS FROM https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
define('BM_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY', 'pk_test_YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE');
define('BM_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', 'sk_test_YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE');

// DVLA API (GET NEW KEY FROM https://developer-portal.driver-vehicle-licensing.api.gov.uk/)
define('BM_DVLA_API_KEY', 'YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE');

/* That's all, stop editing! Happy publishing. */
```

### Step 2: Verify Plugin Functionality

After adding keys to wp-config.php:
1. Go to WordPress Admin → Blue Motors → Settings
2. Check "API Settings" tab
3. Verify Stripe and DVLA keys are detected
4. Test a booking to ensure everything works

### Step 3: Add Google Calendar Credentials (If Using)

Place your Google Calendar service account JSON file at:
```
wp-content/plugins/blue-motors-southampton/vendor/service-account-credentials.json
```

**Note:** This file is excluded from Git via .gitignore

**Solution:** 
1. Verify Stripe keys are correct
2. Check if using test keys for test payments
3. Review Stripe dashboard for error details

### Issue: "Vehicle lookup not working"
