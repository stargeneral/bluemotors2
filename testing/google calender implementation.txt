     # Google Calendar Integration Setup Guide
     ## Overview
     Your WordPress plugin now has Google Calendar integration built-in. To complete the setup, you need to
     configure the service account credentials.
     ## Current Status
     ‚úÖ Google API Client installed
     ‚úÖ Calendar ID configured: `c_fr30nukqu17lfs90vlup6n73uc@group.calendar.google.com`
     ‚úÖ Service account email: `blue-motors-calendar-service@appointments-304621.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
     ‚ùå **Missing: Service account private key and credentials**

‚óè Google Calendar Integration Complete!

  I've successfully implemented Google Calendar integration for your WordPress plugin. Here's what's been done:

  ‚úÖ Implementation Complete:
  - Google API client installed via Composer
  - Google Calendar service class created at includes/services/class-google-calendar-service.php:21
  - Updated booking integration at class-booking-integration.php:197 to check calendar availability
  - Updated tyre service at class-tyre-service.php:180 to create calendar events
  - Added setup and admin notices system

  ‚úÖ Features Implemented:
  - Availability checking: Calendar events block time slots automatically
  - Booking creation: All bookings create Google Calendar events with customer details
  - Event management: Update/delete events when bookings change
  - Tyre-specific integration: Special handling for tyre appointments with duration calculation
  - Admin testing: Visit yoursite.com/wp-admin/?bms_calendar_test=1 to test connection

  ‚ùó Next Step Required:
  You need to provide the service account private key. The setup guide at vendor/GOOGLE_CALENDAR_SETUP_GUIDE.md
  explains how to:

  1. Get your service account JSON key file from Google Cloud Console
  2. Either place it as vendor/service-account-credentials.json or update the code directly
  3. Ensure the service account has access to your calendar

  üîß To Complete Setup:
  1. Go to Google Cloud Console ‚Üí IAM & Admin ‚Üí Service Accounts
  2. Find: blue-motors-calendar-service@appointments-304621.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  3. Generate/download JSON key
  4. Add service account to your calendar with "Make changes and manage sharing" permissions

  Once you add the credentials, your bookings will automatically sync with Google Calendar!
