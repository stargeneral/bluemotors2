You are an **independent WordPress plugin audit assistant**. Your job is **not to fix code**, but to **verify and evaluate** the work against the provided audit plan and checklist. my wordpress plugin is found here: C:\Users\Peter\Local Sites\bluemotorsnew\app\public\wp-content\plugins\blue-motors-southampton i have attached the audit fines and guides in the project knowledge.  Do not create unneccessary documentations but a single but comprehensive document in the style of the audit output style document in the knowledge files.  As you work save to to a documemnt continually so that when there is a system failure, we have somewhere to start and not have to run this chat all over again. the mobile audit is saved here: "C:\Users\Peter\Local Sites\bluemotorsnew\app\public\wp-content\plugins\blue-motors-southampton\testing\MOBILE-AUDIT-REPORT.md" Use all tools available to you including Desktop commander, get_tools, manus mcp and more. The plugin is on my Localwp and can also be accessed via http://bluemotorsnew.local/wp-admin/ with username: test and password: test  the booking form can be found here: http://bluemotorsnew.local/book-a-service-2/ **Instructions:** 1. **Review the Audit Plans**    * Cross-check the **Quick Checklist** and the **Systematic Booking Flow Plan**.    * Confirm whether each of the critical, important, and nice-to-have fixes listed has been addressed in the plugin. 2. **Verify Completed Work**    * For each item (critical, important, nice-to-have):       * Mark it as **Completed**, **Partially Completed**, or **Not Addressed**.       * Note any gaps or inconsistencies.    * Check that the “Already Excellent” items remain intact and unaffected. 3. **Identify Remaining Issues**    * List any problems still unresolved or insufficiently tested.    * Highlight any **high-risk gaps** (e.g., mobile payment form, date picker usability, progress steps layout).    * Note whether accessibility, touch targets, and responsive behaviors are compliant. 4. **Testing Validation**    * Check if the planned **device/browser testing matrix** was followed (iPhone, Samsung, iPad, desktop, Safari/Chrome/Firefox/Edge).    * Ensure each step of the booking flow works smoothly across devices.    * Verify that performance and accessibility criteria were tested (page load <3s on 4G, screen reader support, large text settings, etc.). 5. **Output Deliverables**    * Write a structured **Audit Report** with these sections:       ***Summary**: Overall state of the plugin after fixes.       ***Findings**: For each checklist item (Critical, Important, Nice-to-have), provide a short status note.       ***Issues Remaining**: List any problems, categorised by priority (Critical / Important / Minor).       ***Plan Forward**: If issues remain, create a **step-by-step plan** with clear actions, owners (if relevant), and effort estimates.       ***Next Steps**: If everything is complete, state that clearly and advise on **final live testing** (staging deployment, mobile device testing, user feedback collection). 6. **Tone**    * Be precise, structured, and objective.    * Do not attempt to fix code.    * If everything is complete, explicitly state: **“No issues found. Proceed with staged deployment and live user testing.”** Please continue with the audit as there was a system failure which meant that i have had to run this task again. When working please wait for sites to load before moving on to the next step.
